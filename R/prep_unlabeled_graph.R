#' Prepared Unlabeled Graph to work with Degree-Betweenness Algorithm
#'
#' Presently, \code{cluster_degree_betweenness()} function only works with labeled graphs. \code{prep_unlabeled_graph()} is a utility function that gives an unlabeled graph labels which are string values of their vertices.
#'
#' @param graph an unlabeled graph.
#' @return An "igraph" object with named vertices.
#' @seealso [cluster_degree_betweenness()] which this function aids.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' library(igraph)
#' library(igraphdata)
#' library(ig.degree.betweenness)
#' data("UKfaculty")
#' # Making graph undirected so it looks nicer when its plotted
#' uk_faculty <- prep_unlabeled_graph(UKfaculty) |>
#'   as.undirected()
